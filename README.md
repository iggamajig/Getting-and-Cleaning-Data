##Tidy Data
The following code produces two tidy data sets.  These are tidy data sets because:
####Each variable measured is in a different column.
####Each different observation of that variable is in a different row.
####There is a row at the top of each file with descriptive variable names
####Variable names are human readable. For example, "standard deviation" is used for names instead of "std".
