The included R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

####Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
####Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
This script uses all measurements that include either a mean or standard deviation, including additional vectors from the angle() variable because they consist of mean signals. 
####Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
This script uses descriptive activity names place replacing the Activity ID numbers with the names of each activity, drawn from the activity_labels.txt file in the original data set.
####Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
This script translates all abbreviations from the data set into full words to make the variables human readable, a requirement for a tidy data set. Names were established by interpretting variables based on features_info.txt in the source files.  This final edit to the data set is saved as TidySet.txt
####From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
This second tidy data set is saved in the working directory as "TidySet2.txt"  It is created by aggregating the mean of each variable for each activity and each subject.

##Variables
These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

Mean value
Standard deviation

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean
